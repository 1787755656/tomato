Date:   2012-06-24

    libevent: resurrect evdns_set_random_bytes_fn() and add evdns_set_random_init_fn().
    Using the provided RC4 generator is nice, but we maybe want to use something
    else, in particular if we need something that is guaranteed to work in a
    chroot jail, without a /dev/*random device.

Date:   2012-06-24

    libevent: don't use memset(<something on the stack>) to securely wipe a buffer,
